## How to make a loop that pauses for 5 minutes after each set of 25 iterations until its done?
for x in 100:
    #what to do every time (100 times): replace this line with your every-iteration functions.
    if x % 5 == 0:
        #what to do every 5th time: replace this line with your nth-iteration functions.
